This will generate some screenshots and save them to the Play Store metadata folder.

1) Set the correct value for the device size by setting the `destination` variable
2) Start the correct emulator and
   run `flutter drive --driver=test_driver/screenshot_driver.dart --target=integration_test/make_screenshots_test.dart`
3) If you get errors or the screenshots are not written to disk, edit the
   `languages` list and comment some of the languages
